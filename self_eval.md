# Self Evaluation

1. When is it useful to use a `conditional` in your code?
 - When you are trying to compare variables to find true or false.
1. If you could do this assignment over, what would you do differently?
 - I think I did pretty well. If possible I would have done it earlier in the day. Maybe I would have played around with the code even more. 
1. What about your thinking, learning, or work today brought you the most satisfaction? Why?
 - I feel a lot better than yesterday. I asked a question in slack and one of the cohort mates responded to assist. I was able to complete everything with minor errors and figuring it out myself to get past the error responses. :)
